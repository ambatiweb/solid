# SOLID Principles

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should be responsible for a single, well-defined task. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to understand, modify, and debug code.
   
## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code.
   
## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if you can use a subclass anywhere you can use its parent class, and the program should still work as expected.
   
## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead, large interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific interfaces that clients can implement independently.
    
## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstract interfaces should be used to make the code more flexible and testable.
